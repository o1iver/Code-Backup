Add this patch to your ~/.mozilla/mozpluggerrc file. As long as Gnash
is in your path, then MozPlugger will use Gnash to render flash movies.

MozPlugger is available from http://mozplugger.mozdev.org. It's a
plugin that runs external programs in a web browser, more commonly used
for video.

The downside is the plugin can't handle any input from the mouse or
keyboard. The upside is it works fine playing many of the simple flash
movies on many web sites. Course most of them are ads. :-) This should
also work for 64 bit platforms.
